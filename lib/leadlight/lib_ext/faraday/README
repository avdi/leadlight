This directory contains monkeypatches to the Faraday library, on which
Leadlight is based.

I feel really bad for doing this, and I fully intend to work with
Mislav to come up with some mutually-agreeable changes to the Faraday
API which will eliminate the need for this directory to exist. This is strictly an interim measure.
